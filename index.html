            			<p class="cred">My education post high school started at ..... After this I stated my college eductaion at UC East Bay where ... My post grad education was completed at...where I ... My first educational position was at... I also ... blah blah....My name is Lucia and recently graduated from UC San Diego with my Master's of Education and Multiple Subject Teaching Credential. I am from Half Moon Bay, a precious coastal town in the San Francisco Bay Area, but I am here to stay in the San Diego summer sunshine. For my undergraduate work, I attended Cal State East Bay in Hayward and received my B.A. in Philosophy, June 2013. My current ambition for teaching is to further develop my Spanish language through night classes, in order to fulfill the final component to earn the Bilingual Authorization. It would be wonderful to work with ESL students in bilingual classrooms.</p>

         			<div class="col-sm-6">

            			<h2 class="intro"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

								<p class="intro-main">When I was an undergraduate at Cal State East Bay, I spent hundreds of hours reading other people's philosophies, or in other words, what they think about different issues. What I have taken away from studying for my Philosophy major is that I will always be a student, and if I maintain this attitude, I will be wise and knowledgeable in life.<br><br>

								So what does that mean in regards to my teaching? It means that I believe in learning from my own experiences and mistakes, from other educators, or even by listening to my students on what they think. One purpose of education is to create an enlightened community of people who value integrity, professionalism, commitment, self-reflection and evaluation, and above all seeking knowledge to support each other through life. All people are equal, and should have access to education in the highest quality available. One of my goals as a teacher is to learn how to reach to all children, no matter the challenges that they face. This is a huge factor in my decision in having the BLA on my credential, since non-native English speakers are currently underserved in this country. At UC San Diego I am learning about the history of inequality in the education system, the solutions towards equity, and my own power as a teacher to change it.<br><br>

								Teachers are not limited to their impact in the classroom however; they also raise awareness politically to ignored problems, by connecting with their community and being part of the group of people who live there. This might show when a teacher runs for the school district board or city council, they volunteer to pick up trash in neglected areas, attend annual community events, go to their student's sport games, create a student council for their elementary school, and so on.<br><br>

								I understand my responsibility as a teacher to take care of those around me by using my voice and wisdom in any situation, even if that means outside of the school I work in. I promise to continue to learn about the injustices in the education system, so that I may be part of the solutions. I will always work with the students that I encounter with an open mind and heart, maintaing the faith that they will become someone great if they know what they're capable of, and help them receive the support they need from their other teachers and classmates.</p>

								<h2 class="philosophy">Philosophy of Education</h2>

								<p class="phil">When I teach the students I work with, there are reasons for doing things a particular way, whether that may be seen in my interactions with the children, how I teach them, or what I use to deepen their understanding of the content. One of my strongest values in teaching has been to develop the appropriate skills that will allow me to work with any student that I am confronted with, and I have done this by trying different strategies that experienced teachers have wrote about, or that professors have taught me through the Multiple Subject Credential program at University of California, San Diego. The following is my teaching philosophy, which consists of three parts to illustrate my beliefs that are embedded in my teaching style: equity and diversity, pedagogy, and technology. I am confident about these philosophies because after trying different strategies I know other teachers use, I have reflected on my personal experiences in the classroom to see which ones are most effective for my students and me.</p>

								<h2 class="equity">Equity and Diversity</h2>

								<p class="e-q">I am passionate to provide equity in my classroom by acknowledging the diversity of my student body through understanding their individual needs and challenges, allowing me to support them in their academic and characteristic growth. I will get to know the students personally through casual and formal conversations, classroom surveys, journal writing, and reaching out to their family. As simple as it sounds, where I have gotten to know my students in my teaching experiences has been outside of my lessons, when they want to talk to me about what is going on in their life. In the mornings especially before school starts, students like Melanie have shared with me personal stories, her interests, and her concerns about school. This is also a time to talk to parents, guardians, and relatives, who bring their child to school, such as Melanie's dad who would come in the classroom to check in on her progress. I think that their family will know more about the student than I do, and it is a valuable resource to turn to in the beginning of the school year.<br><br>

								 In regards to cultural diversity, I will welcome multiple perspectives in the content areas I teach so that the children understand that their culture is respected and worthy to teach about in an American classroom. One example of this is to teach about the indigenous perspective when teaching social studies and students learn about conquerors and settlers. I have asked my students questions to make them think critically about both sides: why did Colombus enslave the indigenous people? How would the indigenous people feel about Colombus? These questions are of multicultural perspective because they examine both sides, not just Spain's. I will also do my best to find resources for families who speak languages other than English, such as translators, when I send home forms, letters, or have meetings with them about their child. In the past, I have experienced a meeting where the child was the translator, and the connection becomes lost between the parent or guardian and the teacher, which can misconstrue information and create confusion about what's being said.<br><br>

								Some examples of student types that I am prepared to work with are students of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, especially for English Language Learners, students with special educational needs, including GATE and IEP students, as well as students who are below basic in different content areas for their grade level. Ways that I plan to support English Language Learners are using SDAIE strategies regularly, following the English Language Development Standards and linking them to other content areas, and finding resources outside the classroom such as an after school reading group. Most students I have taught were English Language Learners, and they needed direct teaching of the language throughout all content areas. I would give them explanations on sentence structures, have them compare and contrast between their first language and English, and encourage them to practice academic language with a partner using pre-modeled sentence frames. Other students I have worked with were part of GATE. In my curriculum, GATE students will have options to complete assignments through project based learning or suggestions made by their family, as well as opportunities to think about concepts from multiple entrances. These opportunities will not be limited to those who are GATE, because I have met students who learn better through projects that are not GATE, and I think that many students could benefit from this type of learning. What is important to me is to provide options for my students, since no learner is exactly alike. <br><br>

								For IEP students, I will see what grade level content they can understand to help keep them learning with their peers without watering down the information, but giving them any accommodations necessary to ensure their success. Students who are below basic for their grade level will be provided scaffolds to give them support needed to learn the content, and attention will be given to the reasons why they are far behind. Some possible things to consider are motivational struggle, health issues, family concerns, and learning disabilities. Working with the student through scaffolds is equally important as dealing with the cause of the them falling behind. In one of my placements I worked with a third grader named Adrianna, a student on an IEP who was very far below grade level. Rather than assume she is incapable of learning grade level content, I showed her that I expected her best effort, and gave her strategies to figure out math problems that her classmates were doing. For example, if she was given a multi-digit subtraction problem, she wouldn't be able to start because she did not know how to subtract. So together, I showed her how to count on using her fingers, a strategy that she could use independently to do the problem. It was exciting to see how much growth she made in math using other strategies as well, which was all she needed to succeed on many grade level concepts. It taught me that assuming what the child won't be able to do will inhibit their academic growth, and lower their confidence. All students need a teacher who believes in them, and holds high expectations, so that they try their best.</p>

								<h2 class="pedagogy">Pedagogy</h2>

								<p class="ped">Before consistent and meaningful learning will come into place, it's inevitable to build a safe space for the students to share their ideas and learn from each other. I think that incorporating social-emotional awareness and lessons are valuable to the students who likely need to practice getting along with others to cooperate in pair conversations and group work. Students will learn skills such as being respectful, careful, thoughtful, and kind to create a close knit community. One way that I will teach students how to show others they are respectful, careful, responsible, thoughtful, or kind is through interactive modeling. Some examples that they will learn are how to listen to the speaker, let others know how they feel using I-Statements, stand up for each other against bullying, and keeping track of their homework or pencils. If a safe space is not established, bullying may happen, and the consequences of being bullied will impact a child's education. For example, a student who was neglected at home, and eventually taken away from her family by the CPS, had lice throughout the year. The other children made fun of her and called her gross, afraid to be near her. I began working with her class at the end of the school year, and although she no longer has lice, students were still afraid to touch her backpack. The tension between her and other students made it difficult for her to have partner talks, because no one wanted to partner up with her. This is just one example of many situations that prevented her from comfortably participate in lessons like the other students were. I talked to her classmates about kindness and compassion to encourage them to think about how they would feel if they were being bullied. It was rewarding to see students reach out to her, and even though not all students were her friend, a few made it easier to finish up the school year. She eventually had classmates who want her in their group and enjoyed having partner discussions with her too.<br><br>

								Once there is a community built where the students are beginning to open up and feel safe, I will emphasize in my pedagogy lesson planning for all student needs, collaborating with other teachers to analyze and reflect on lessons and assessments, giving student feedback and having them reflect on their own learning, and incorporating English language arts, English language development, social studies, math, science, health, arts, and physical education into my curriculum. In my lesson plans, I will pay careful attention to the language demands of the content objective and have differentiation prepared for all of my students, whether they have a 504 Plan, an IEP, are English language learners, or are GATE. In addition, collaborating with other teachers means we can share ideas on what works and what doesn't, examine our students from a whole grade perspective to collect data, and figure out what the students need to do better throughout the classes. I will prioritize giving student feedback in a timely manner to show them where they understand the content, and what areas they need to work on. Students should have opportunities to make goals for learning, and through reflections, assess their own academic progress. Also, independently they can think about their learning, and see what is either pushing them to become a stronger student, or what is making them feel less motivated. Although students are not tested in subjects outside of science, math, and language arts, Incorporating all of the content areas in the curriculum is important because they help develop students thinking in different ways. For example, art allows for creative expression and inventive thinking, while inquiry science teaches them to question the world around them and hypothesize different explanations. Each subject teaches different skills to the student, and incorporating all of them into the curriculum is crucial for students to develop these skills.</p>

								<h2 class="technology">Technology</h2>

								<p class="tech">Use of technology in the classroom can make teaching and learning more efficient, when it is not depended on for the students to maintain engagement. I think the document camera gives students a way to see teacher modeling so that they can see exactly what she expects them to do on a worksheet or lined paper, and can show the text of the book that is being read for students to follow along—which is especially valuable to English Language Learners. Students that were newcomers in my previous placements were not able to understand what the other children did without pictures, and providing pictures next to vocabulary words on the document camera helped them to make connections with their prior knowledge. The Promethean board allows students to interact with the content area by being able to manipulate shapes, words, or pictures that were already created by their teacher, making the most efficient use of the subject area time. It is also a great way to give students the chance to teach each other, by demonstrating the steps in a math problem, and explaining what they are doing with academic language. Having laptops in the classroom gives students practice with typing, which is unavoidable in college and many careers. There are also many individualized learning softwares that are made available through computers or laptops in school, such as Learning Upgrade or Successmaker. Technology can also be important for students with special needs, where teachers may need to use a microphone, headphones can help some students focus if they're easily distracted, and visual aids provide access for a lot of children.<br><br>

								To conclude, these are important reasons that are the foundation for my teaching practices. I believe that diversity is inevitable in any public classroom that I will work in California, that it will change the structure of my pedagogy among several other factors, I will continue to embed equity in every interaction with my students and choices I make as their teacher, and to embrace the technology that will continue to be integrated globally in our everyday lives. My teaching philosophies are based on my own experiences, and I predict they will evolve as my experiences in this profession continue to grow.</p>
